            One day, Harry Tran told Michael that he brang a lot of prime and takis from the US to Vietnam to sell (1*). A neuron cell from Michael's brain suddenly poped up with an
            idea about start-up a business, right after that, he bought every primes and takis from Harry Tran. On 27/12/2024, Michael was finding a person to sell primes.
            At first, he reached out one of his followers name Kuah and started to ask if she was intererested in buying prime or takis or not. However, things did not come with what Michael expected,
            she did not buy primes nor takis but she was willing to be a sales girl. She found some of the customers through her friend's list and then Michael were the one who responded to them. Unfotunately, Michael also needs
            someone to ship the order. H
